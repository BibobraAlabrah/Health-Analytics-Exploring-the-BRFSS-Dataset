# Research questions:

This is a very interesting and robust dataset with several possible research questions. 
For curiosity sake, I have chosen these two for consideration.

Research quesion 1: 

Is a person's chance of getting a heart attack related to regular medical check ups, and lack of money for medicine 
due to cost? I think is very interesting because routine medical checkups may or may not be that influencial given that these this chronic 
condition come unexpectedly. Money is always an issue so it will be interesting to see its impact.

Research quesion 2: 

Is depression disorder prevalent amongst the less educated, low income earners, employment status, married or single, 
which gender suffers most? This fascinates me because depression cuts across all classes of people but I am sure that there are some 
correlations.
